### Getting started with contributing

Some of the issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/issues) are marked with the "Newbie" label. If you're interesting in contributing to Storm but don't know where to begin, these are good issues to start with. These issues aren't anticipated to be a lot of work, require learning about only an isolated portion of the codebase, and are a great way to get your feet wet with learning the codebase.

### Sending patches

Contributions to the Storm codebase should be sent as GitHub pull requests. If there's any problems to the pull request we can iterate on it using GitHub's commenting features.

### Modules built on top of Storm

Modules built on top of Storm (like spouts, bolts, etc) that aren't appropriate for Storm core can be done as your own project or as part of [storm-contrib](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-contrib). To be part of storm-contrib just send an email to the mailing list proposing to add your module to storm-contrib. Then you'll be added as a committer to storm-contrib and can maintain your project there. The advantage of hosting your module in storm-contrib is that it will be easier for potential users to find your project.

### Contributing documentation

Documentation contributions are very welcome! The best way to send contributions is as emails through the mailing list.
